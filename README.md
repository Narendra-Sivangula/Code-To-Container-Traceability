## 📌 Overview

Modern CI/CD pipelines often answer **what was built** and **what was deployed**,  
but they fail to answer the most critical question:

> **What code is actually running in the cluster right now, and how is it behaving?**

This project solves that problem by providing **true Code-to-Container Traceability** —  
linking **Git commits → Jenkins builds → container images → Kubernetes pods → runtime behavior**  
in a **single, unified observability platform**.

⚠️ **Important:**  
This is **not** just a dashboard collection.  
It is a **data-driven traceability system** built from first principles.

## ✨ What Makes This Project Unique

- ✅ End-to-end **code lineage** (commit → build → image → pod)
- ✅ Runtime truth sourced directly from Kubernetes
- ✅ Clear separation of **CI claims** vs **actual runtime state**
- ✅ Correlation of **deployments with performance and stability impact**
- ✅ No dependency on vendor-specific APM tools
- ✅ Designed using **real SRE / production observability principles**

> To the best of my knowledge, this **complete flow is not documented or implemented publicly** as a single open-source reference.
