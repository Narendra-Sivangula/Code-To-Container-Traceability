# Code-to-Container Traceability & Observability Platform

> **End-to-end CI → CD → Runtime → Health → Metrics → Impact observability**  
> built using Docker, Jenkins, ArgoCD, Kubernetes, OpenSearch, Prometheus, and Grafana.

---

## 📌 Overview

Modern CI/CD pipelines typically answer **what was built** and **what was deployed**,  
but they fail to answer the most critical operational question:

> **What code is actually running in the cluster right now, and how is it behaving?**

This project solves that problem by providing **true Code-to-Container Traceability** —  
linking:

**Git commits → Jenkins builds → container images → Kubernetes pods → runtime behavior**

into a **single, unified observability platform**.

⚠️ **Important**  
This is **not** just a dashboard collection.  
It is a **data-driven traceability system** designed from first principles using real SRE practices.

---

## ✨ What Makes This Project Unique

- ✅ End-to-end **code lineage** (commit → build → image → pod)
- ✅ Runtime truth sourced directly from Kubernetes
- ✅ Clear separation of **CI claims** vs **actual runtime state**
- ✅ Correlation of **deployments with performance and stability impact**
- ✅ No dependency on vendor-specific APM tools
- ✅ Built using **open standards and open-source components**

> To the best of my knowledge, this **complete end-to-end flow is not publicly documented or implemented** as a single reference architecture.

## 🧩 Core Components

### 🔹 CI Layer (Build Truth)

- **Jenkins**
- Captures:
  - `build_id`
  - `job_name`
  - `branch`
  - commit metadata
  - authors
  - image tag & immutable image digest
- Indexed into **OpenSearch (`ci-build-metadata`)**

---

### 🔹 CD Layer (Deployment Truth)

- **ArgoCD**
- Captures:
  - deployment name
  - namespace
  - pod name
  - image & digest
  - node placement
- Indexed into **OpenSearch (`deployment-metadata`)**

---

### 🔹 Runtime Traceability Layer (Source of Truth)

- **Custom Traceability Aggregator**
- Enriches live Kubernetes runtime data with:
  - CI build metadata
  - Image digest verification
  - Pod classification (`application` / `system`)
- Produces the **final truth layer**
- Indexed into **OpenSearch (`ctc-traceability`)**

---

### 🔹 Metrics Layer

- **Prometheus**
- Collects:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Resource requests & limits
- Used to correlate **deployments with runtime impact**

---

### 🔹 Visualization Layer

- **Grafana**
- Datasources:
  - OpenSearch (traceability & metadata)
  - Prometheus (metrics)
- Provides **correlated, low-noise dashboards**

---

## 📦 OpenSearch Indexes & Purpose

| Index Name            | Purpose |
|-----------------------|--------|
| `ci-build-metadata`   | Build-time truth from Jenkins |
| `deployment-metadata`| Deployment-time truth from ArgoCD |
| `ctc-traceability`    | Runtime truth combining CI + CD + Kubernetes |

This separation ensures:
- No data duplication
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Accurate historical traceability

---

## 🎯 Key Observability Principles Used

- **Runtime truth over pipeline claims**
- **Artifact immutability via image digests**
- **Correlation over isolated visualization**
- **Low-noise, high-signal dashboards**
- **Production-first design**

This project intentionally avoids:
- Blind log dumping
- Uncorrelated metrics
- Vendor lock-in APM assumptions

## ⭐ Why This Project Matters

Most systems answer:

> “Did the pipeline succeed?”

This project answers:

> **“Is the right code running, is it healthy, and did my change cause impact?”**

That distinction is **everything in production systems**.
